            <h3 id="Goals" class="offset-scroll">Goals</h3>
            <p>&emsp;During my work term as a full-stack developer, I set several goals to grow my technical skills, improve my problem-solving abilities, and get a better understanding
              of how software development works in a real-world setting. These goals were directly tied to my tasks at work, which made it easier to focus on learning while contributing
              to the team. I wanted to build skills that would not only help me during this term but also prepare me for future internships and full-time roles in the tech industry.</p>

            <p>&emsp;One of my main goals was to learn how to use version control effectively in a team environment. Version control is a big part of software development, and I knew it would be
              important to understand how to follow team workflows while keeping the code organized and conflict-free. By the end of the term, I had successfully followed all the version control
              strategies used by the company and really understood why they are so important for collaboration. This experience gave me a lot of confidence in working on shared codebases,
              which I know will be useful in future jobs.</p>

            <p>&emsp;Another goal I had was to understand how the back-end and front-end of an application work together. As a full-stack developer, I had the chance to work on both sides
              of the application and see how they communicated using HTTP requests and responses. This hands-on experience really helped me understand the flow of data between the front-end
              and back-end, and I was able to contribute to projects that required seamless integration between the two.</p>

            <p>&emsp;I also wanted to improve my debugging and problem-solving skills. Since many of my tasks involved fixing bugs, I got a lot of practice isolating issues and figuring out solutions.
              By the end of the term, I felt much more confident in my ability to troubleshoot problems and come up with efficient fixes. I know these skills will be essential in any development
              role I take on in the future.</p>

            <p>&emsp;Another important goal for me was to learn about data security and compliance, especially for SaaS applications. I completed a developer security course and applied
              best practices to my code, which helped the team pass the annual penetration test without any vulnerabilities being flagged in my work. This was a great learning
              experience, as it gave me a firsthand look at how important security is in software development and how to implement it effectively.</p>

            <p>&emsp;Lastly, I wanted to get better at front-end development, specifically using Vue.js. I had never worked with Vue.js before, so I spent time learning how it works
              and applying it to our projects. By the end of the term, I had a solid understanding of Vue.js and was able to use it effectively to improve the website’s user interface.
              This was one of the most exciting parts of the work term because I could see the direct impact of my work.</p>

            <p>&emsp;Looking back, I’m proud to say I achieved all of my goals for this term. Each one helped me grow as a developer and gave me skills that I’ll carry forward into my next roles.
              This experience showed me how valuable it is to set clear goals and take advantage of every learning opportunity.</p>

            <h3 id=JobDescription class="offset-scroll">Job Description</h3>
            <p>&emsp;At Emailgistics, my role primarily involved fixing bugs reported by customers and adding new functionality when needed. Working with a system built
              on a set of microservices deployed to Azure using Kubernetes, I had the opportunity to dive into modern cloud-based technologies. The most interesting aspect
              of the job was troubleshooting and resolving issues in a live production environment, which required a mix of debugging skills, problem-solving, and attention to detail.
              Many of the skills I used, such as understanding microservices architecture and cloud deployment, were new to me and learned on the job. However, foundational programming
              concepts and debugging techniques from my coursework helped me quickly adapt and succeed in this role.</p>

            <h3 id="Conclusion" class="offset-scroll">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>&emsp;My work term at Emailgistics was a valuable learning experience that helped me grow both technically and professionally. From mastering version
              control and debugging to understanding the interaction between front-end and back-end systems, I gained practical skills that directly contribute to real-world
              software development. Working with modern technologies like Vue.js, microservices, Kubernetes, and Azure deepened my technical knowledge while tackling
              challenges like data security and compliance broadened my perspective on industry best practices. Overall, this experience allowed me to contribute meaningfully
              to projects while preparing me for future opportunities in the tech field.</p>
